iSticky iPad [and iPhone:orientation] sticky footer

An experiment in how it might be possible to target devices using media queries. Due to uneven @media browser support additional client-side detection will most assuredly deliver a better user experience across all browsers and platforms.

* Uses css @media queries to point iphone, ipad and "all" other formats to unique stylesheets.
